# Splunk-Log-Analysis-Real-Time-Brute-Force-Detection
# Project Overview
From data ingestion to real-time threat detection and alerting, this project shows how to set up a fundamental Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) pipeline. It focuses on using Splunk to detect SSH brute-force attacks against a Linux system, which are simulated using the Hydra tool.
